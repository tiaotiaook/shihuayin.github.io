      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently in the final year of my Computer Science degree. I am
        very interested in web development, and I am particularly fascinated by
        using React to build dynamic user interfaces. At the same time, I am
        passionate about efficiently managing and integrating databases, aiming
        to seamlessly connect the front end with the back end to deliver better
        user experiences and data processing capabilities.

            <h3>TED Persuasive Adjective Explore</h3>
            <p>
              This is an analysis project based on TED talk transcripts, aimed
              at studying the most persuasive adjectives and their sentiment
              tendencies in TED talks. Using natural language processing
              techniques, I extracted adjectives from the most popular TED talks
              of the past decade in fields such as Technology, Science, and
              Business, and generated word clouds. Additionally, I conducted
              sentiment analysis on these talks to explore the persuasive
              adjectives used in different fields and the speech styles they
              reflect.
